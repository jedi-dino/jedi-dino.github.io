If you're looking at this then don't judge the very disasterfied code. This code is very unsafe and shouldn't be used in deployment probably maybe idk at this point.

Hey, at least it uses MongoDB instead of PHP lol. Still, don't use any of this in production. Change over to React if needed.

Main backend has been switched to React but not transferred here sooooooooo yeah.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
